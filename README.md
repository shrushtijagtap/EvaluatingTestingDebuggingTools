# Evaluating Testing and Debugging Tools on Real-world Bugs

### üöÄ Project Overview

This repository presents our exploration of **automated testing and debugging techniques** using real-world bug datasets. The primary focus was to evaluate how well tools like **Randoop** and **EvoSuite** perform in identifying and localizing bugs, automating workflows, and improving debugging efficiency.  

The work significantly reduces debugging time and offers a robust framework for **bug localization**, ensuring software reliability.

### üìã Key Features

1. **Automated Test Generation**  
   - **Randoop**: Feedback-directed random test generation for error-revealing and regression tests.  
   - **EvoSuite**: Automatic test suite generation using genetic evolution algorithms to optimize coverage.

2. **Bug Localization Techniques**  
   - Calculation of **suspiciousness scores** for code statements to rank potential bug-causing elements.  
   - Advanced ranking methods for pinpointing faulty code sections with high precision.

3. **Benchmarking Bug Datasets**  
   - Worked with datasets like **Defects4J**, **Bears**, **BugSwarm**, and **QuixBugs**, including over 835+ bugs.
   - Extracted and analyzed metrics such as code coverage, complexity changes, and similarity distances.

4. **Automation & Efficiency**  
   - Scripts developed to automate tasks like bug extraction, test generation, benchmarking, and visualization.
   - Achieved a **95% reduction in debugging time** through automated workflows and advanced tools.
