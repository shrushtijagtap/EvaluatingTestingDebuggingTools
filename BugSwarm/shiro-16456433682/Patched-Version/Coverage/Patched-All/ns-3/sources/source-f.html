&nbsp;
&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;A simple username/password authentication token to support the most widely-used authentication mechanism.  This
&nbsp; * class also implements the {@link RememberMeAuthenticationToken RememberMeAuthenticationToken} interface to support
&nbsp; * &amp;quot;Remember Me&amp;quot; services across user sessions as well as the
&nbsp; * {@link org.apache.shiro.authc.HostAuthenticationToken HostAuthenticationToken} interface to retain the host name
&nbsp; * or IP address location from where the authentication attempt is occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Remember Me&amp;quot; authentications are disabled by default, but if the application developer wishes to allow
&nbsp; * it for a login attempt, all that is necessary is to call {@link #setRememberMe setRememberMe(true)}.  If the underlying
&nbsp; * &lt;tt&gt;SecurityManager&lt;/tt&gt; implementation also supports &lt;tt&gt;RememberMe&lt;/tt&gt; services, the user&#39;s identity will be
&nbsp; * remembered across sessions.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;Note that this class stores a password as a char[] instead of a String
&nbsp; * (which may seem more logical).  This is because Strings are immutable and their
&nbsp; * internal value cannot be overwritten - meaning even a nulled String instance might be accessible in memory at a later
&nbsp; * time (e.g. memory dump).  This is not good for sensitive information such as passwords. For more information, see the
&nbsp; * &lt;a href=&quot;http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/security/jce/JCERefGuide.html#PBEEx&quot;&gt;
&nbsp; * Java Cryptography Extension Reference Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;To avoid this possibility of later memory access, the application developer should always call
&nbsp; * {@link #clear() clear()} after using the token to perform a login attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; *
