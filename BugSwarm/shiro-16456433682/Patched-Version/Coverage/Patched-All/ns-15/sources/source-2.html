&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * A default event bus implementation that synchronously publishes events to registered listeners.  Listeners can be
&nbsp; * registered or unregistered for events as necessary.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * An event bus enables a publish/subscribe paradigm within Shiro - components can publish or consume events they
&nbsp; * find relevant without needing to be tightly coupled to other components.  This affords great
&nbsp; * flexibility within Shiro by promoting loose coupling and high cohesion between components and a much safer
&nbsp; * pluggable architecture that is more resilient to change over time.
&nbsp; * &lt;h2&gt;Sending Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&nbsp; * If a component wishes to publish events to other components:
&nbsp; * &lt;pre&gt;
&nbsp; *     MyEvent myEvent = createMyEvent();
&nbsp; *     eventBus.publish(myEvent);
&nbsp; * &lt;/pre&gt;
&nbsp; * The event bus will determine the type of event and then dispatch the event to components that wish to receive
&nbsp; * events of that type.
&nbsp; * &lt;h2&gt;Receiving Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&nbsp; * A component can receive events of interest by doing the following.
&nbsp; * &lt;ol&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;For each type of event you wish to consume, create a public method that accepts a single event argument.
&nbsp; * The method argument type indicates the type of event to receive.&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;Annotate each of these public methods with the {@link org.apache.shiro.event.Subscribe Subscribe} annotation.&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;Register the component with the event bus:
&nbsp; * &lt;pre&gt;
&nbsp; *         eventBus.register(myComponent);
&nbsp; *     &lt;/pre&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;/ol&gt;
&nbsp; * After registering the component, when when an event of a respective type is published, the component&#39;s
&nbsp; * {@code Subscribe}-annotated method(s) will be invoked as expected.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * This design (and its constituent helper components) was largely influenced by
&nbsp; * Guava&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/eventbus/EventBus.html&quot;&gt;EventBus&lt;/a&gt;
&nbsp; * concept, although no code was shared/imported (even though Guava is Apache 2.0 licensed and could have
&nbsp; * been used).
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * This implementation is thread-safe and may be used concurrently.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * @since 1.3

&nbsp;
&nbsp;    //We want to preserve registration order to deliver events to objects in the order that they are registered
&nbsp;    //with the event bus.  This has the nice effect that any Shiro system-level components that are registered first
&nbsp;    //(likely to happen upon startup) have precedence over those registered by end-user components later.
&nbsp;    //
&nbsp;    //One might think that this could have been done by just using a ConcurrentSkipListMap (which is available only on
&nbsp;    //JDK 6 or later).  However, this approach requires the implementation of a Comparator to sort elements, and this
&nbsp;    //surfaces a problem: for any given random event listener, there isn&#39;t any guaranteed property to exist that can be
&nbsp;    //inspected to determine order of registration, since registration order is an artifact of this EventBus
&nbsp;    //implementation, not the listeners themselves.
&nbsp;    //
&nbsp;    //Therefore, we use a simple concurrent lock to wrap a LinkedHashMap - the LinkedHashMap retains insertion order
&nbsp;    //and the lock provides thread-safety in probably a much simpler mechanism than attempting to write a
&nbsp;    //EventBus-specific Comparator.  This technique is also likely to be faster than a ConcurrentSkipListMap, which
&nbsp;    //is about 3-5 times slower than a standard ConcurrentMap.
