&nbsp;
&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * A {@code SubjectRunnable} ensures that a target/delegate {@link Runnable Runnable} will execute such that any
&nbsp; * call to {@code SecurityUtils.}{@link org.apache.shiro.SecurityUtils#getSubject() getSubject()} during the
&nbsp; * {@code Runnable}&#39;s execution will return the associated {@code Subject} instance.  The {@code SubjectRunnable}
&nbsp; * instance can be run on any thread (the current thread or asynchronously on another thread) and the
&nbsp; * {@code SecurityUtils.getSubject()} call will still work properly.  This implementation also guarantees that Shiro&#39;s
&nbsp; * thread state will be identical before and after execution to ensure threads remain clean in any thread-pooled
&nbsp; * environment.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * When instances of this class {@link Runnable#run() run()}, the following occurs:
&nbsp; * &lt;ol&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;The Subject and any of its associated thread state is first bound to the thread that executes the
&nbsp; * {@code Runnable}.&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;The delegate/target {@code Runnable} is {@link #doRun(Runnable) run}&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;Any previous thread state that might have existed before the {@code Subject} was bound is fully restored&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;/ol&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;h3&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * This is typically considered a support class and is not often directly referenced.  Most people prefer to use
&nbsp; * the {@code Subject.}{@link Subject#execute(Runnable) execute} or
&nbsp; * {@code Subject.}{@link Subject#associateWith(Runnable) associateWith} methods, which transparently perform the
&nbsp; * necessary association logic.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * An even more convenient alternative is to use a
&nbsp; * {@link org.apache.shiro.concurrent.SubjectAwareExecutor SubjectAwareExecutor}, which transparently uses
&nbsp; * instances of this class but does not require referencing Shiro&#39;s API at all.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * @see Subject#associateWith(Runnable)
&nbsp; * @see org.apache.shiro.concurrent.SubjectAwareExecutor SubjectAwareExecutor
&nbsp; * @since 1.0
