&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Interface used to indicate deserializers that want to do post-processing
&nbsp; * after construction but before being returned to caller (and possibly cached)
&nbsp; * and used.
&nbsp; * This is typically used to resolve references
&nbsp; * to other contained types; for example, bean deserializers use this callback
&nbsp; * to locate deserializers for contained field types.
&nbsp; * Main reason for using a callback (instead of trying to resolve dependencies
&nbsp; * immediately) is to make it possible to cleanly handle self-references;
&nbsp; * otherwise it would be easy to get into infinite recursion.
&nbsp; *&lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Note that {@link #resolve} method does NOT allow returning anything 
&nbsp; * (specifically, a new deserializer instance): reason for this is that
&nbsp; * allowing this would not work with proper handling of cyclic dependencies,
&nbsp; * which are resolved by two-phase processing, where initially constructed
&nbsp; * deserializer is added as known deserializer, and only after this
&nbsp; * resolution is done. Resolution is the part that results in lookups for
&nbsp; * dependant deserializers, which may include handling references to
&nbsp; * deserializer itself.
&nbsp; *&lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Note that in cases where deserializer needs both contextualization and
&nbsp; * resolution -- that is, implements both this interface and {@link ContextualDeserializer}
&nbsp; * -- resolution via this interface occurs first, and contextual
&nbsp; * resolution (using {@link ContextualDeserializer}) later on.
